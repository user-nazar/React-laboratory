# Task: React.js: Catalog page

Description: Continue work on your React App by adding a page with Items list (see the link to wireframe of Catalog page above).

Requirements: 
All of the requirements for previous React.js works should be kept.
Code style: 
Use array.map() method for rendering your items list.
Routing (switching between pages) should work now. 
Use react-router-dom library: https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start .
All UI elements (buttons / select) should have corresponding React components (PrimaryButton.jsx / Select.jsx  etc.)
Functionality (filter / search / view more) is still not required (you have to complete it on next works)
